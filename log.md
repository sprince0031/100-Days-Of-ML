# Sprince0031's 100 Days of ML LOG

## Day 0 : Jan 14, 2019

<b> Today's Progress:</b> Did some basic setup to get started for the challenge, mostly involving installing various python libraries that will come in handy for this journey. Most importantly, set my mind on seeing this challenge through.

<b> Thoughts:</b> Really excited for this and hope this will kickstart my ML journey.

## Day 1 : Jan 15, 2019

<b> Today's Progress:</b> Started off with reviewing Linear Algebra topics. Going to ensure my Linear Algebra foundations are strong before I get into any more of the ML topics.

<b> Thoughts:</b> The <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OCW</a> lectures are going to be a real boon and a good source of knowledge.

<b> Work:</b> Completed lectures upto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA&list=PL221E2BBF13BECF6C&index=6">this</a> on the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm">MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra</a> course.

## Day 2 : Jan 16, 2019

<b> Today's Progress:</b> Learned core concepts of Decision Trees, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machines. Worked with ML libraries - pandas, numpy, sklearn and used few classifiers from the sklearn library.

<b> Thoughts:</b> Learned a few concepts and got to use those in code via the sklearn library.
