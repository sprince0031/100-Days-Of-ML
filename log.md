# Sprince0031's 100 Days of ML LOG

## Day 0 : Jan 14, 2019

<b> Today's Progress:</b> Did some basic setup to get started for the challenge, mostly involving installing various python libraries that will come in handy for this journey. Most importantly, set my mind on seeing this challenge through.

<b> Thoughts:</b> Really excited for this and hope this will kickstart my ML journey.

## Day 1 : Jan 15, 2019

<b> Today's Progress:</b> Started off with reviewing Linear Algebra topics. Going to ensure my Linear Algebra foundations are strong before I get into any more of the ML topics.

<b> Thoughts:</b> The <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OCW</a> lectures are going to be a real boon and a good source of knowledge.

<b> Work:</b> Completed lectures upto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA&list=PL221E2BBF13BECF6C&index=6">this</a> on the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/index.htm">MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra</a> course.

## Day 2 : Jan 16, 2019

<b> Today's Progress:</b> Learned core concepts of Decision Trees, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machines. Worked with ML libraries - pandas, numpy, sklearn and used few classifiers from the sklearn library.

<b> Thoughts:</b> Learned a few concepts and got to use those in code via the sklearn library.

<b> Work:</b> <a href="https://github.com/sprince0031/100-Days-Of-ML/commit/6ae026d7baffdba1d9441f549f26af6e6f619ae7">commit 6ae026d7baffdba1d9441f549f26af6e6f619ae7</a>

## Day 3 : Jan 17, 2019

<b> Today's Progress:</b> Saw how to split data sets into training and testing sets and why it should be done. Learnt about over fitting and under fitting. Plotted my first graphs(kind of a disaster *facepalm*).

<b> Thoughts:</b> Have to figure out a way to plot the graphs appropriately according to the data and also how to properly resize lists so that they can be compared.

<b> Work:</b> <a href="https://github.com/sprince0031/100-Days-Of-ML/commit/5a91b5a00892f1f453a6d7d4d85137140e882479">commit 5a91b5a00892f1f453a6d7d4d85137140e882479</a>

## Day 4 : Jan 20, 2019

<b> Today's Progress:</b> Learnt a thing or two about cleaning data to exclude invalid or unavalable data from the data set. Understood the importance of this step.

<b> Thoughts:</b> Been sick and so a couple of days have been skipped. Not moving as fast as I wanted to. Have to pick up the pace.
